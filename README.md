DOG-Breed Game 
---------------
About the game
--------------
-This is the quiz type memory game/app where we can know about more details about the dog breeds.
-One random picture of the dog breed will be fetched from the API, and there will be random question about that particular fetched dog breed.

Why
----
This is our 4th team project week. We have to built this app/game in order to get familiar with React, Redux, Web Development and especially the usage of GIT, when we are working in an Agile way.
